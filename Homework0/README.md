# Homework 0: Thoughts on Ungrading

## 1. What are your thoughts on the Ungrading practice as it applies in general to teaching and learning (not necessarily specifically to this class)?

I think that the ungrading practice is both a good and bad practice. In theory it is good to motivate students to learn for the sake of learning but many students can take advantage of this liberty to not work well.

## 2. What are your thoughts on the way Ungrading will be applied to this class based on what has been explained by your instructor and what is described in the syllabus?

I think that the ungrading policy in this class is the equivalent of minimal feedback hindging on few deliverables. I don't yet know if the feedback will be able to adequately give students a good enough unerstanding of their performance to give themselves the proper grade. 

## 3. On the scale from 1 to 5, how confident are you in that you can earn an A in this class (1 is lowest, 5 is highest)?

I would say I'm at a 4 due to my late entry to the class.
